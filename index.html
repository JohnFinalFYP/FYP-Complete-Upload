          This website is for education purposes on the ever growing effects of climate change. The reason why I picked
          this for my final year project was to have somewhere people could learn about this topic but also mainly for
          my self. I had many ideas for this site when it started off, I wanted it to be a visual journey but after some
          feedback from friends and family the main feeling was that it was far to flashy and there wasn't enought facts and content to learn from. They looked through other climate change sites I sent them and they said it would be great if I could take all the immportants parts from these websites and lay them out in an easier and nicer way to read. So this is the design that people really liked and I hope you guys will like it as well! Climate change is becoming a big problem, bigger then some want to admit if we don't start to change now our future generations will be fighting a battle we could of helped to slow down.
          Without further ado, lets get into the early history of climate change. I want to say that all information on this site is from repected sourses with studies behind and facts to back up their claims.

                In simple terms climate can be described as the average weather over a period of time.  Climate change means a significant change in the measures of climate, such as temperature, rainfall, or wind, lasting for an extended period – decades or longer. The Earth's climate has changed many times during the planet's history, with events ranging from ice ages to long periods of warmth.  What’s different about this period of the earth’s history is that human activities are significantly contributing to natural climate change through our emissions of greenhouse gases. This interference is resulting in increased air and ocean temperatures, drought, melting ice and snow, rising sea levels, increased rainfall, flooding and other influences.

              Scientists attribute the global warming trend observed since the mid-20th century to the human
              expansion of the "greenhouse effect" — warming that results when the atmosphere traps heat
              radiating from Earth toward space. Certain gases in the atmosphere block heat from escaping.
              Long-lived gases that remain semi-permanently in the atmosphere and do not respond physically or
              chemically to changes in temperature are described as "forcing" climate change. Gases, such as
              water vapor, which respond physically or chemically to changes in temperature are seen as
              "feedbacks."

              The planet's average surface temperature has risen about 1.62 degrees Fahrenheit (0.9 degrees Celsius) since the late 19th century, a change driven largely by increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions into the atmosphere. Most of the warming occurred in the past 35 years, with the six warmest years on record taking place since 2014. Not only was 2016 the warmest year on record, but eight of the 12 months that make up the year — from January through September, with the exception of June — were the warmest on record for those respective months.

          Since the beginning of the Industrial Revolution, the acidity of surface ocean waters has increased by about 30 percent. This increase is the result of humans emitting more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere and hence more being absorbed into the oceans.

Sub-Arctic boreal forests are likely to be particularly badly affected, with tree lines gradually retreating north as temperatures rise. In tropical forests such as the Amazon, where there’s abundant biodiversity, even modest levels of climate change can cause high levels of extinction.            </p>

              Scientists have high confidence that global temperatures will continue to rise for decades to come, largely due to greenhouse gases produced by human activities. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which includes more than 1,300 scientists from the United States and other countries, forecasts a temperature rise of 2.5 to 10 degrees Fahrenheit over the next century.

              According to the IPCC, the extent of climate change effects on individual regions will vary over time and with the ability of different societal and environmental systems to mitigate or adapt to change.

              The IPCC predicts that increases in global mean temperature of less than 1.8 to 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit (1 to 3 degrees Celsius) above 1990 levels will produce beneficial impacts in some regions and harmful ones in others. Net annual costs will increase over time as global temperatures increase.

              In 2013, about 1.3 billion people lived in water scarce regions, according to one study. The researchers calculated that an additional 8% of the population would enter a state of "new or aggravated water scarcity," solely due to climate change with a temperature increase of 2 degrees C by 2100.

      Because many reptiles rely on ambient temperatures to regulate physiological processes, they will be directly affected by global temperature change. For turtles, nest temperature determines the sex of the offspring. A cooler nest hatches only males while a warmer nest is all females. Changes in sex ratio could effect the potential to produce offspring as well as the evolutionary fitness the species, according to the Forest Service, both factors which do not bode well for the survival of the reptiles. Animals with similar problems could include other turtles, alligators, crocodiles, and some lizards. </div>

              In its Fifth Assessment Report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, a group of 1,300 independent scientific experts from countries all over the world under the auspices of the United Nations, concluded there's a more than 95 percent probability that human activities over the past 50 years have warmed our planet.
              The industrial activities that our modern civilization depends upon have raised atmospheric carbon dioxide levels from 280 parts per million to 412 parts per million in the last 150 years. The panel also concluded there's a better than 95 percent probability that human-produced greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and nitrous oxide have caused much of the observed increase in Earth's temperatures over the past 50 years.

              The Paris Agreement sets out a global framework to avoid dangerous climate change by limiting global warming to well below 2°C and pursuing efforts to limit it to 1.5°C. It also aims to strengthen countries’ ability to deal with the impacts of climate change and support them in their efforts.

              The Paris Agreement is the first-ever universal, legally binding global climate change agreement, adopted at theParis climate conference (COP21) in December 2015.

              The EU and its Member States are among the close to 190 Parties to the Paris Agreement. The EU formally ratified the agreement on 5 October 2016, thus enabling its entry into force on 4 November 2016. For the agreement to enter into force, at least 55 countries representing at least 55% of global emissions had to deposit their instruments of ratification.

              The EU’s nationally determined contribution (NDC) under the Paris Agreement is to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by at least 40% by 2030 compared to 1990, under its wider 2030 climate and energy framework. All key EU legislation for implementing this target was adopted by the end of 2018.

              As we can see multiple respected sources are providing the hard facts and yet we have people in power who want to ignore all the clear signs. The longer we take to act the more damage we are going to do to our planet. I didn't realise how many things were going to effect us till I really started looking into it. One of the things that really stuck out to me was the the ecomic challenges us as a world are going to face. The thought of people losing their homes in the future due to the people who can push and make a change not doing it. We need to act NOW to give our future generation a better chance of more enjoyable life. Next I will visualize some data.

              When possible, walk or ride your bike in order to avoid carbon emissions completely. Carpooling and public transportation drastically reduce CO2 emissions by spreading them out over many riders. High mileage doesn’t always mean low CO2 emissions. All vehicles have an estimated miles-per-gallon rating. Electric cars emit no CO2 if they’re charged with clean electricity. If you don’t charge it with your home’s solar panels AND live somewhere like WY, MO, MO, WV, or KY you’re BETTER OFF with a hybrid or high-mileage gas/diesel car. Here’s why. After incentives and gas savings, it essentially costs nothing to switch to an electric car like the the Nissan Leaf.

              Make energy efficiency a primary consideration when choosing a new furnace, air conditioning unit, dishwasher, or refrigerator. Products bearing the ENERGY STAR label are recognized for having superior efficiency. Turn off lights you’re not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact flourescent or LED ones. Add solar panels to the roof of your home. This costs a little more than the above options, but many providers offer financing options which minimize upfront costs.

            Global sea level has been rising over the past century, and the rate has increased in recent decades. In 2014, global sea level was 2.6 inches above the 1993 average—the highest annual average in the satellite record (1993-present). Sea level continues to rise at a rate of about one-eighth of an inch per year.</p>

              Rising Sea Levels will have catistrophic effects on the oplanet. Higher sea levels are coinciding with more dangerous hurricanes and typhoons that move more slowly and drop more rain, contributing to more powerful storm surges that can strip away everything in their path. One study found that between 1963 and 2012, almost half of all deaths from Atlantic hurricanes were caused by storm surges. Already, flooding in low-lying coastal areas is forcing people to migrate to higher ground, and millions more are vulnerable from flood risk and other climate change effects. The prospect of higher coastal water levels threatens basic services such as Internet access, since much of the underlying communications infrastructure lies in the path of rising seas.

              In the aforementioned study, the University of Zurich revealed that glacial melting has accelerated over the last three decades. This loss of ice has already reached 335 billion tonnes per year, which is 30% of the current rate of ocean growth. The main consequences of deglaciation are:

              The University of Arizona proposed a seemingly simple solution: manufacture more ice. Their proposal consists of collecting ice from below the glacier through pumps driven by wind power to spread it over the upper ice caps, so that it will freeze, thus strengthening the consistency.

         This is the end of the website and I hope you learned a lot and enjoyed! It's important that we start doing everything we can to reduce the effects of climate change AS SOON AS POSSIBLE. It's important that we can give future generations the same experience we had while growing up. Our Earth is such a beatiful place full of amazing nature that is going to start dissapearing in the future. 2030 isn't far away and from what you have seen from the facts on this website things are going to get bad. I hate to sound all doom and gloom but procrastinating is the worst thing we can. Try your best to lower your carbon footprint even if it's just something small everything helps.
